            <p class="para">Not long ago, I challenged a group of young people to reflect on the development progress
                achieved so
                far. And to look at current challenges with the same sense of resolve. I did the same, with optimism and
                confidence in the World Bank Group’s ability to step up and do even more.

                When it comes to improving people’s lives, there’s always more to be done. More impact to have. More
                lives to transform.

                In today’s troubled world, achieving results is imperative. More than ever, development results—as well
                as capturing lessons and trends in what works — is what should drive us. Only then can we track our
                progress toward our ultimate goal: a world free of poverty on a livable planet.</p>
            <div>
                <h3 class="headings">The World Bank Group scorecard</h3>
                <p class="para">This is the journey we’re on, driven by outcomes and evidence. Measuring our results is
                    a cornerstone
                    of our work to become more transparent, accountable, and deliver impact that changes lives. Through
                    our new World Bank Group scorecard, we will get a better sense of how we are doing, where we are
                    going, and where we want to be.

                    Today, we’re releasing the first 11 of 22 indicators, from how many students have benefited from
                    better education to how many people are using broadband internet to how many people got access to
                    safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.

                    More than numbers, these are critical indicators to inform our strategies, enhance transparency,
                    help us identify gaps, and enrich our dialogue with country and partners. They offer us an
                    opportunity to assess the relevance of our priorities at the country level, supporting clients on
                    how to make the best choices and investments for people.

                    It’s a work in progress and only reflects part of our total portfolio. Later this year, we will
                    share the data for the full set of the remaining indicators, and we will continue to refine our
                    methodologies and gather more and better data.

                    The scorecard is transforming the way we measure outcomes. By unifying data from the World Bank,
                    International Finance Corporation, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, we amplify our
                    collective strength. Together, we can better target public sector interventions, pinpoint
                    transformative private investments, and identify where risk mitigation will unlock critical
                    projects. </p>

                <p class="para"><a id="link" target="_blank"
                        href="https://x.com/intent/post?text=What+does+the+preliminary+data+tell+us%3F+So+far%2C+the+scorecard+suggests+progress+in+many+areas%2C+but+also+that+much+work+remains+to+be+done.&url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.worldbank.org%2Fen%2Fvoices%2Fhow-people-s-lives-have-improved-what-our-world-bank-group-scorecard-tells-us%3Fcid%3DSHR_WBLTweetable_EN_EXT&via=worldbank&original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.worldbank.org%2Fen%2Fvoices%2Fhow-people-s-lives-have-improved-what-our-world-bank-group-scorecard-tells-us&source=tweetbutton&hashtags=">What
                        does the preliminary data tell us? So far, the scorecard suggests progress in many areas, but
                        also that much work remains to be done.</a></p>
                <h3 class="headings">Take food security:</h3>
                <p class="para">To date, the data captured in our active portfolio has helped feed 156 million people*.
                    Roughly 50
                    percent of them live in countries affected by conflict and fragility, where help is most needed. And
                    nearly half of all the people we help are women and girls.

                    But are we doing enough? Look at Africa, for instance. Our portfolio supports almost a quarter of
                    Africa’s food insecure population. While this is significant, we must redouble efforts to mobilize
                    the private sector and development partners and deploy our knowledge more effectively to scale up
                    our impact. </p>
                <h3 class="headings">Moving Forward</h3>
                <p class="para">These examples offer just a few of the provisional insights from our new scorecard. But
                    the story is
                    not complete yet. This is just the start, and our data will become firmer over time.

                    My takeaway is clear: It’s time for all of us to double down on transparency and accountability for
                    results, learning from what works and what doesn’t, and adjusting as we go together on this journey.
