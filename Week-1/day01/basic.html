        <h1>History of India</h1>
        <p>India’s rich history dates back millennia. The ancient Indus civilization (2600–1900 BCE) thrived in the northwestern part of the subcontinent. Over time, India developed a distinctive tradition associated primarily with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The Vedic period (1500–500 BCE) saw the composition of extensive hymns (Vedas), and the rise of regional cultures led to the synthesis of Hinduism.</p>
        <p>Chandragupta Maurya established the Maurya Empire, and Ashoka embraced Buddhism, promoting nonviolence and peace. The Gupta Empire (4th–6th centuries CE) marked India’s classical or Golden Age, influencing much of Asia. India’s history is a tapestry of dynasties, cultural exchanges, and intellectual achievements.</p>

        <h1>Civics in India</h1>
        <p>On January 26, 1950, India emerged as a sovereign democratic republic, celebrating Republic Day annually. The adoption of India’s constitution on that day marked a significant milestone. The country follows a parliamentary system, with universal adult franchise. The government structure includes the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).</p>
        <p>India’s federation divides powers between the central government and state governments, emphasizing linguistic states and regional languages. While the president holds a ceremonial role, elections occur at least every five years, maintaining democratic principles3.</p>

        <h1>Economics of India</h1>
        <p>India’s economy has transitioned from a mixed planned economy to a mixed middle-income developing social market economy. It ranks as the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). Consumption and investments drive India’s domestic demand, contributing to 70% of economic activity.</p>
        <p>Despite challenges, India’s growth outpaces major economies, and it aims to climb to the third spot by 2027. Key industries include textiles, chemicals, food processing, steel, software, and pharmaceuticals. Exports and imports play crucial roles, with the US, EU, and UAE as major partners45."</p>
